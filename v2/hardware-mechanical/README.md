## V2 Parrallel Hybrid Supercapacitor Scooter

Mechanical Setup pretty simple. The only problem was how to mount the hub motor in parrallel with the Internal Combusion Engine. 

The parts are listed in the ./parts/parts.txt

The solution was to offset CVT Transmission enough to fit the electric motor.

### Closer look at the engine trans adapter. What was fabricated ( no pic ) was a shaft adapter that fit to the existing spline and extended by 40 mm and had new splines for the transmission pulleys
