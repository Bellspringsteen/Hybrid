## Hybrid Vehicle Project

This is not meant as a easily reproducable or educational guide/project for building your own system. Maybe one day. It is mostly a collection of information, with large sections missing, of my personal project.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to explore greater fuel saving in vehicles, not by minimizing fuel usage of a class of vehicles (such as compact cars). But instead work towards world wide reductions in fuel usage by keeping consumers from switching to less fuel effficient vehicles.

As an example, consider the fuel benefits of a jump in US passenger fleet from an average fuel economy of 23 mpg to 30 mpg. And constract this to fuel usage if billions of the worlds population currently traveling by 50cc scooter upgrades to pasenger cars. 

The goal of this project is to explore vehicle configurations that will allow smaller engines to outperform in acceleration larger engines. And thereby allow consumers to upgrade vehicles without upgrading to larger less efficient engines.

# Versions
## Version 1.0 is a Series Hybrid Super Capacitor Motorcycle
